# TwoThreeTree

This code contains a balanced 2-3 Tree data structure coded from scratch, which includes a Tree class and Node class. The 2-3 tree is known to be balanced, meaning each leaf is at the same level. It is known as a 2-3 tree, since every node either has one data element and two children, or two data elements and three children.

The Node class stores data elements of type string. Within the main function, there is a menu displayed in the standard output, allowing a user to insert a string, remove a string, print the tree in pre-order, in-order, and post-order, or search for a string within the balanced tree.
